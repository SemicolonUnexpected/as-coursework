Flame tests,Why is nichrome wire used?,It is unreactive and has a high melting point
Titration,Apparatus for a titration,Pipette\, safety filler\, burette\, beakers\, filter funnel\, conical flasks\, volumetric flask
Titration,Describe how to make a standard solution,- Weigh an accurate mass of solid (in a weighing boat) and dissolve the solid in a beaker (of an appropriate volume) containing deionised water\n- Rinse the weighing boat and add the washings to the beaker\n- Stir the solution with a glass rod and then rinse this glass rod with deionised water into the beaker\n- Pour the prepared solution from the beaker into a volumetric flask using a filter funnel. When the transfer is complete rinse the beaker and add the washings to the flask\n- Rinse the filter funnel with deionised water\n- Remove the filter funnel and continue to add deionised water to the flask until it lies just below the fill line\n- Place a stopper in the flask and invert the solution to mix. Allow the solution to settle\n- Using a plastic pipette\, add deionised water dropwise to the flask until the bottom of the meniscus lies on the fill line\n- Place a stopper in the flask and invert to mix thoroughly
Titration,Describe how to carry out a titration,- Prepare a burette\n- Fill the burette with its solution and record the initial reading from the burette scale\n- Prepare a pipette\n- Fill the pipette until the bottom of the meniscus is on the fill line and transfer the solution to a conical flask\n- Add a few drops of indicator to the solution in the conical flask\n- Add the solution from the burette to the conical flask with swirling until a permanent colour change is observed - Record the final reading on the burette scale and calculate the volume added\, this will be the rough titre value\n- A further two titrations should be completed but the burette solution should be added dropwise when within 1 cm3 of the rough titre value. These accurate titre values should be concordant – within 0.1 cm3 of each other. If necessary continue to repeat the titration until concordant results are obtained
Alkenes,What is the functional group in an alkene?,C=C
Titration,Draw a table for a titration,- Headings with units\n- Values to 1d.p.\n- Rough and accurate values differ by at most 1cm³\n- Accurate values differ by at most 0.1cm³\n- Table should be boxed (like a fish)\n- Correct subtractions\n- Average titre from only accurate titres to at least 1 d.p.
Intermolecular Forces,Which atoms can form hydrogen bonds?,Nitrogen\, oxygen\, fluorine
Titration,Describe how to prepare a pipette,- Rinse with deionised water using a pipette filler/n- Discard water/n- Rinse with solution/n- Discard solution/n- Fill with solution until the bottom of the meniscus is on the line/n- Empty into a conical flask and touch the tip to the surface\n- Empty into a conical flask and touch the tip to the surface
Titration,Describe how to prepare a burette,- Rinse (ensuring jet) with deionised water\n- Discard water\n- Rinse (ensuring jet) with solution\n- Discard solution\n- Fill burette to approx. 3cm³ above the line with solution then drain till the bottom of the meniscus is on the mark. Ensure the jet is filled
Formulae,What is the moles equation?,Moles = mass / RFM
